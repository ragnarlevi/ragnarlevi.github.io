My supervisors are Prof. Dimitris Christopoulos and Prof. Gareth Peters. Generally, I am most interested in problems involving statistics and machine learning, with applications in risk management and insurance. My current research explores how graph kernels can be used for two-sample hypothesis testing with applications in portfolio optimization.</description></item><item><title>Data Visualization and Data Reduction</title><link>https://ragnarlevi.github.io/post/data_visualization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ragnarlevi.github.io/post/data_visualization/</guid><description>Introduction In this notebook I will be trying out some dimensionality reduction techniques which can be used for modelling and/or data visualization. Dimensional reduction occupies a central position in many fields. In essence, the goal is to change the representation of data sets, originally in a form involving a large number of variables, into a low-dimensional description. The main difference between data reduction and data visualization is that some data visualization techniques can not be used on unseen data, thus they will not be useful in the modelling part.</description></item></channel></rss>
