These ideas are important for risk managers as International banking regulations require banks to pay specific attention to the probability of large losses over short periods of time and undeerestimation of dependence among extreme risks can lead to serious consequences, as for instance those we experienced during the last financial crisis. Including extreme risks in probabilistic models is recognized nowadays as a necessary condition for good risk management in any institution, and not restricted anymore to reinsurance companies, who are the providers of covers for natural catastrophes.</description></item></channel></rss>
