The goal is to look at the eigen decomposition of the return correlation matrix. The decomposition allows us to separate the correlation into three parts. Namely, the marketwide effect, group correlation matrix and a random noise part. By filtering out the marketwide effect and the random noise, we can look at nontrivial correlation of stock groups.</description></item><item><title>Data Visualization and Data Reduction</title><link>https://ragnarlevi.github.io/post/data_visualization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ragnarlevi.github.io/post/data_visualization/</guid><description>Introduction In this notebook I will be trying out some dimensionality reduction techniques which can be used for modelling and/or data visualization. Dimensional reduction occupies a central position in many fields. In essence, the goal is to change the representation of data sets, originally in a form involving a large number of variables, into a low-dimensional description. The main difference between data reduction and data visualization is that some data visualization techniques can not be used on unseen data, thus they will not be useful in the modelling part.</description></item></channel></rss>
