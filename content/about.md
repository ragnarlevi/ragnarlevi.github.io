### Ragnar Leví­ Guðmundarson 
#### Heriot-Watt, Centre for Networks and Enterprise Excellence

I started my PhD at Heriot-Watt University in January 2021 at the Edinburgh campus. My supervisors are Prof. Dimitris Christopoulos, [Prof. Gareth Peters](https://www.qrslab.com/) and George Tzougas. Generally, I am most interested in problems involving statistics and machine learning, with applications in risk management and insurance. My current research is on Graphical models and network hypothesis testing frameworks with applications in ESG portfolio optimization.

Prior to joining Heriot-Watt I completed my master's degree in Actuarial Science at ISEG (University of Lisbon). I also hold a BSc in applied mathematics and chemical engineering from the University of Iceland.
